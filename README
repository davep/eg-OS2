Hi, contained in this archive is the source for a utility called Expert
Guide, a text mode Norton Guide reader for OS/2.

Eg started life as a bit of C code that did nothing more than dump the
contents of a NG menu structure to stdout, then a messed around a little
more, added a little here, added a little there, and I ended up with all
this C++ code. The state of the code (and the design) shows that it EG
was not very well planned from the start, but I'm making it available
in the hope that it might a) be of use to someone as a utility and 
b) the source may be of use to anyone wanting to dig into the structure
of Norton Guide files.

The best way to use EG is to stick it in the same directory as your NG
files. When you first start it use:

	eg c:\ng\myguide.ng

From then on EG will remember in an INI file (called eg.ini, in the same
directory as eg.exe) what guide you were last looking at. While running
EG you can press Alt-D for a list of other available guies or you can
press Ctrl-D to make it rescan the list (the list is held in eg.ini for
speed reasons).

And that's about it. It's missing a couple of things, not least of which
is a search facilty, I may get round to putting this in one day.

EG was written using EMX/GCC, I've included the Makefile. Note that if you
have not made the omf libs for EMX will will either need to do so or you
will need to change the Makefile so that it does not attempt to compile
for and link against them

I hope you find this of use.
